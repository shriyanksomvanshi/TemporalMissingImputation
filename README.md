# Repo on Temporal Missing Data Imputation

Transportation temporal missing imputation studies focus on addressing the challenge of missing data in transportation-related datasets, particularly those involving temporal aspects. These studies aim to develop methods and 
techniques for estimating or filling in missing data points within time-series transportation data, such as traffic volume, speed, or vehicle trajectories. By effectively imputing missing temporal data, researchers in this 
field seek to enhance the accuracy and reliability of transportation system modeling, optimization, and decision-making processes. These studies often employ various statistical, machine learning, or data-driven approaches 
to handle missing data and improve the overall understanding and management of transportation systems.
